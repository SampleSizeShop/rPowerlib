# This script runs power for the applied power example in 
# Section 5 of the manuscript 
# "Calculating Power for the General Linear Multivariate
#  Model With One or More Gaussian Covariates"

# Applied example based on previous research by
#
# 1. Elashoff D, Zhou H, Reiss J, et al. 
# Prevalidation of salivary biomarkers for oral cancer detection. 
# Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev. 2012;21(4):664â€“672. 
#
# The proposed design is a randomized, clinical trial investigating
# two treatments for oral cancer.  The outcome is an oral cancer 
# salivary biomarker, IL-8, which would be measured at baseline,
# six months, and 1 year.  Covariates include age and baseline IL-8 level.
# The hypothesis is the test of the time by treatment interaction, using
# the Hotelling-Lawley Trace with a Type I error rate of 0.05.
#

# Mean differences from Table 3 in Elashoff et al.
