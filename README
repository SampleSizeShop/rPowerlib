The rPowerlib Package
=========================

The rPowerlib package for R (>3.0.0) calculates power for the general
linear multivariate model with or without Gaussian covariates.  

The package provides companion code for the manuscript:

Kreidler, S. M., Muller, K. E., & Glueck, D. H. 
Calculating Power for the General Linear Multivariate Model 
With One or More Gaussian Covariates, In review.

To replicate the simulation study results in the manuscript
1. Download the zip file from https://github.com/samplesizeshop/rPowerlib
2. Install the package into your local R installation (http://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-admin.html#Add_002don-packages)
3. load the library: 
  
  > library(invWishartSum)

4. Run the simulation study (may take several hours to run with empirical calculations)

  > runSimulationStudy(study.data.dir="myDataDir", study.figures.dir="myFiguresDir", study.runEmpirical=TRUE)

5. Run the applied example

  > runElashoffExample()


### Background ###

This package is based on the SAS/IML product POWERLIB (http://www.jstatsoft.org/v30/i05)
developed by Keith E. Muller and colleagues.
At present, the rPowerlib DOES NOT include the full functionality of POWERLIB.
For features such as power confidence intervals and more statistical tests,
please try POWERLIB (http://github.com/samplesizeshop/powerlib) or 
GLIMMPSE (https://glimmpse.samplesizeshop.org). Please
visit http://SampleSizeShop.org for more information about calculating power and
sample size.
