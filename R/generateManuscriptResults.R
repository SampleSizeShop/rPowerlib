# generateManuscriptResults.R
#
# Generate power results, summary tables, and plots for manuscript
# !!! Be sure to set working directory to this file location prior to running !!!

# load libraries and initialize Java
generateManuscriptResults <- function(genDesigns=TRUE, runEmpirical=FALSE) {
  
}

# define functions

#
#
#



#
# generate the designs for the experiment or load from
# previously generated .Rdata file
#

#
# Calculate empirical power or load csv from previous run
#


#
# Add columns for calculated power using the following methods:
# 1. Kreidler covariate adjust with M adjusted by (N-qf)/(N-qf-qr)
# 2. Kreidler covariate adjust with M
#



#
# Write the power results to a csv file
#


#
# Generate the box plots showing deviations from
# empirical power
